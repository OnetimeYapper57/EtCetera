      <description>A synthetic performance-enhancing drug developed for space marines during the early days of interplanetary warfare. Go-juice blocks pain, increases movement speed, and improves the user's melee and shooting abilities. The military chemists who created it were never able to remove its addictiveness. Some saw this as a downside; others saw it as a benefit. Withdrawal symptoms include intense tiredness and muscular exhaustion, increased hunger, and hypersensitivity to pain. The withdrawal is relatively brief, however, lasting about 11 days without further doses.\n\nDespite its name, it is not recommended to drink it.</description>
