							<description>A vicious tribe of fire-spewing impids. This particular tribe has no intention of coexisting peacefully with anyone else. Their warriors are experts at using their natural speed and flame attacks to burn their rivals and keep a safe distance with their flamebows.\n\nHaving been here for thousands of years, the origins of this tribe are lost in myth. They might descend from a group of settlers who lost their technology, or an impid community in some long-ruined civilisation.</description>

							<description>A loose coalition of orbital traders. Together they form an orbital marketplace that buys and sells goods from around the planet. Orbital traders will also buy goods from the occasional interplanetary trading vessel, giving them access to rare technologies that cannot be manufactured on this planet, like gravcores and shuttle engines.\n\nThese merchants are rarely found on the planet itself, preferring to live in the safety of their orbital platforms.</description>
