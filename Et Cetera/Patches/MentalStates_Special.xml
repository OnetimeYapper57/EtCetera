      <beginLetter>{0} was calm once upon a time. A simple being participating within the circle of life. But through their own will alone or perhaps through foreign intervention, they have lost that calm. Primal hormones inherited from progenitors that ruled long ago surge and the blood runs hot as {0} finds a new way to interpret the circle of life. {0} has gone manhunter!</beginLetter>
