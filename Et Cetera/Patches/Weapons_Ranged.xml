				<match Class="PatchOperationReplace">
					<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_PumpShotgun"]/description</xpath>
					<value>
						<description>An ancient design of shotgun that emits a tight-packed spray of pellets. Deadly, capable of staggering humans, and possessing an acceptable fire rate, but short range. This reliable but effective weapon has been a mainstay of industrial societies for centuries.</description>
					</value>

				<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_ChainShotgun"]/description</xpath>
				<match Class="PatchOperationReplace">
					<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_ChainShotgun"]/description</xpath>
					<value>
						<description>A magazine-fed fully automatic shotgun. It is even shorter-ranged than a typical shotgun, but is extraordinarily dangerous due to burst fire. Its high recoil and rapid fire rate make it inaccurate, especially in inexperienced hands.</description>
					</value>
				</match>
			</li>
			<!-- Minigun -->

				<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_Minigun"]/description</xpath>
				<match Class="PatchOperationReplace">
					<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_Minigun"]/description</xpath>
					<value>
						<description>A multi-barrel machine gun. It's unwieldy, but once it starts firing it fires very fast. Where most self-loading guns are powered by the energy from the gunpowder, the minigun uses an electric motor to rapidly cycle cartridges through the weapon.\nHighly inaccurate, and takes a long time to aim and cool down, but devastatingly effective on large, bunched-up groups, as each missed shot has another potential target to hit.\n\nWielders of miniguns often become very protective of them, nicknaming their weapon or talking about its steep operating costs and high power to anyone who will listen.</description>

			<!-- Revolver -->

				<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_Revolver"]/description</xpath>
				<match Class="PatchOperationReplace">
					<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_Revolver"]/description</xpath>
					<value>
						<description>An ancient pattern double-action revolver. According to an ancient philosopher, six shots from it is "more than enough to kill anything that moves." Despite this, it's not very powerful, but has a decent role in close-quarters combat and is quick on the draw. Its large bullets are capable of staggering humans.</description>
					</value>

			<!-- Bolt Action Rifle -->
			<li Class="PatchOperationConditional">
				<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_BoltActionRifle"]/description</xpath>
				<match Class="PatchOperationReplace">
					<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_BoltActionRifle"]/description</xpath>
					<value>
						<description>An ancient pattern bolt-action rifle. With its very long range, good accuracy, and low fire rate, it is unlikely to drive animals to revenge, which makes it a favorite weapon for hunting. It's outclassed at short ranges, however, and requires a skilled user to be effective.</description>
					</value>
				</match>
			</li>
			<!-- Heavy SMG -->
			<li Class="PatchOperationConditional">
				<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_HeavySMG"]/description</xpath>
				<match Class="PatchOperationReplace">
					<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_HeavySMG"]/description</xpath>
					<value>
						<description>A compact, wide-caliber slug-thrower. It's got a very short range, but it packs a punch and handles quite well, making it suitable for less skilled shooters with defensive fortifications.</description>
					</value>
				</match>
			</li>
			<!-- LMG -->
			<li Class="PatchOperationConditional">
				<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_LMG"]/description</xpath>
				<match Class="PatchOperationReplace">
					<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_LMG"]/description</xpath>
					<value>
						<description>A gas-operated light machine gun. While it is somewhat unwieldy and inaccurate, its long bursts of fire are effective against groups of enemies. It does not slow the wielder as much as a minigun, and can stagger humans.</description>
					</value>
				</match>
			</li>
			<!-- Assault Rifle -->
			<li Class="PatchOperationConditional">
				<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_AssaultRifle"]/description</xpath>
				<match Class="PatchOperationReplace">
					<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_AssaultRifle"]/description</xpath>
					<value>
						<description>A general-purpose gas-operated assault rifle for field or urban combat. It has good range, decent power, and good accuracy. It is useful in a wide variety of situations, but cannot stagger humans.</description>
					</value>
				</match>
			</li>
			<!-- Charge Rifle -->
			<li Class="PatchOperationConditional">
				<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_ChargeRifle"]/description</xpath>
				<match Class="PatchOperationReplace">
					<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_ChargeRifle"]/description</xpath>
					<value>
						<description>A charged-shot assault rifle. Pulse-charge technology charges each shot with unstable energy as it leaves the barrel. Released on impact, the charged energy greatly increases the damage done. It is very good at piercing armor, but is expensive to manufacture.</description>
					</value>
				</match>
			</li>
			<!-- Charge Lance -->
			<li Class="PatchOperationConditional">
				<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_ChargeLance"]/description</xpath>
				<match Class="PatchOperationReplace">
					<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_ChargeLance"]/description</xpath>
					<value>
						<description>A pulse-charged rail-assisted lance weapon. It fires a single shot at high velocity, charging it with unstable energy as it leaves the acceleration rail. It is capable of shooting off entire limbs, but is slow to fire.</description>
					</value>
				</match>
			</li>
			<!-- Hellcat Rifle -->
			<li Class="PatchOperationConditional" MayRequire="Ludeon.Rimworld.Anomaly">
				<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_HellcatRifle"]/description</xpath>
				<match Class="PatchOperationReplace">
					<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_HellcatRifle"]/description</xpath>
					<value>
						<description>A versatile assault rifle with good range, decent power, and good accuracy. It also comes equipped with a bioferrite-powered mini-burner unit which generates a blast of flame from pressurized bioferrite charges. The mini-burner unit can be used twice before refueling. The burner's blast is effective at warding off nearby targets, but the weight of the burner makes the gun slightly more unwieldy.</description>
					</value>
				</match>
			</li>
			<!-- Incinerator -->
			<li Class="PatchOperationConditional" MayRequire="Ludeon.Rimworld.Anomaly">
				<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_Incinerator"]/description</xpath>
				<match Class="PatchOperationReplace">
					<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_Incinerator"]/description</xpath>
					<value>
						<description>A heavy weapon that can spray a stream of flame into an area. It can shoot in an arc over allies without harming them. The flame burns off rapidly, so it will only ignite the most flammable targets.\nWhile the main flamethrower can be used without limit, the weapon also comes equipped with a bioferrite-powered mega-burner unit which generates a massive blast of flame from a pressurized bioferrite charge. The mega-burner unit must be refueled after each use.\nIt can be used while wearing a shield belt, and it is largely unaffected by Shooting skill.</description>

				<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_NerveSpiker"]/description</xpath>
				<match Class="PatchOperationReplace">
					<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_NerveSpiker"]/description</xpath>
					<value>
						<description>A crossbow-like device that throws rough spikes embedded with a paralytic biotoxin. Low damage, but it stuns organic targets. Large targets are more resistant to the biotoxin and will be stunned for less time. It is effective as a non-lethal weapon.</description>
					</value>
				</match>
			</li>
			<!-- Beam Repeater -->
			<li Class="PatchOperationConditional" MayRequire="Ludeon.Rimworld.Odyssey">
				<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_BeamRepeater"]/description</xpath>
				<match Class="PatchOperationReplace">
					<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_BeamRepeater"]/description</xpath>
					<value>
						<description>An ultratech weapon that emits gamma ray laser bursts in a rapid sequence. The tight gamma beams can pierce shields. It deals heat-based damage, unlike bullet-based firearms which deal sharp damage.</description>
					</value>
				</match>
			</li>
			<!-- Sniper Rifle -->
			<li Class="PatchOperationConditional">
				<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_SniperRifle"]/description</xpath>
				<match Class="PatchOperationReplace">
					<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="Gun_SniperRifle"]/description</xpath>
					<value>
						<description>An ancient design of precision sniper rifle. Bolt action. It has an exceptionally long range, great accuracy and good power. Because it's so unwieldy, other weapons outclass it at close range. It has a very low fire rate, so its damage per second is lacking.</description>
					</value>
				</match>
			</li>
			<!-- Tornado Generator -->
			<!-- This is the worst weapon in the entire game. -->
			<!-- And it's equally rare as a resurrector mech serum. -->
			<li Class="PatchOperationConditional">
				<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="TornadoGenerator"]/description</xpath>
				<match Class="PatchOperationReplace">
					<xpath>Defs/ThingDef[defName="TornadoGenerator"]/description</xpath>
					<value>
						<description>An ancient control unit for a network of weather-control satellites. This device has had certain failsafes bypassed; it is capable of causing a massive air current disturbance, which will generate a tornado at a chosen location.\nThe weather network will detect this unauthorized intrusion and lock out the device after use, but the tornado will be left to spend its energy normally. The tornado is uncontrollable and liable to destroy anything in its path. Attempting to use it as a weapon is likely to result in significant collateral damage.</description>
